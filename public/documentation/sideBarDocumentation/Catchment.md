A Catchment is a group of locations. Catchments are used to segregate areas of operation of each user (or group of users).

The field app will sync only data for the catchment assigned to the logged in user. By dividing into catchments, we ensure that the user has a smaller set of information to work with.

**Uploading catchments**
Catchments can also be created along with users in bulk using the [upload screen](/#/admin/upload).
