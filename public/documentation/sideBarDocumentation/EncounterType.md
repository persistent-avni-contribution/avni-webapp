Encounter Types (also called Visit Types) are used to determine the kinds of encounters/visits that can be performed. An encounter can be scheduled for a specific encounter type using rules. Here, we define that encounter type and the forms associated with the encounter type.

An encounter type is associated to a subject type. It need not be associated with programs (you can perform an annual survey of a population using encounter types not associated with programs, and use this information to enrol subjects into a program).

The encounter eligibility check rule is used to determine eligibility of an encounter type for a subject at any time.
