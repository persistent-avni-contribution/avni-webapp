Your service area is a hierarchy of different locations (eg: district, taluka, village).

A Location is associated with a Location Type. Define Location Types from the [Location Types menu](/#/admin/addressLevelType) before you start adding Locations.

All Subjects are associated with Locations. The field app requires you to provide this location to the lowest level available in the system.

**Uploading Locations**

You can also upload locations in bulk using the [upload screen](/#/admin/upload). When using the upload screen, location types are automatically created.
