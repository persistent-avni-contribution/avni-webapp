Subject Types define the subjects (or things) that you collect information on. eg: Individual, Tractor, Water source, Classroom session.

If you create a subject type with the name "Individual", you get some bonus questions for free in the registration form - first and last names, gender and date of birth.

**Group switch**

Use the group switch to define groups of a certain subject type. eg: A school might decide to define "Class" as a subject type against which information can be captured. It can also contain member subjects that are can have their own information.

**Household**

A household is a special kind of group. Many of the group member types are predefined when you switch on the "Household" switch.
