You can upload users, subjects, enrolments and encounters in bulk in this screen. Metadata zip files that have been downloaded from another organisation can also be uploaded in this screen.

All files except the metadata zip are supposed to be in a [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) format. If you use Microsoft Excel, it has an option to save your spreadsheet in CSV format.

Use the **Download Sample** option to download a sample file. More details about the sample file are available [here](https://dash.readme.io/project/avni/v2.0/docs/upload-data)
